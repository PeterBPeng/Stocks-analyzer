#This is a small project I completed during my FinTech fundamentals course. I created this project to explore how computers can aid in investments. It fetches stock market data, performs analysis, and outputs data for user-specified stocks within a specified time frame. It utilizes visual charts to compare the average annualized returns, annualized volatility returns, and covariance and correlation coefficients of the selected stocks and related data.
